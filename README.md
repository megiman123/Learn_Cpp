# C++ Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my C++ learning repository! This is where I document my progress, store practice code, and track my understanding of C++ concepts.

## 📚 Learning Goals

- [x] Master C++ fundamentals (variables, data types, operators)
- [x] Understand control structures (loops, conditionals)
- [ ] Learn functions and scope
- [ ] Grasp Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- [ ] Explore memory management (pointers, references)
- [ ] Understand STL (Standard Template Library)
- [ ] Practice problem-solving and algorithms
- [ ] Build real-world projects

## 🎯 Current Focus

**Topic:** [Current topic you're learning]
**Goals for this week:**
- start C++
- complete 10 videos of bro code
- Practice and read material from geeks for geeks

## 💡 Key Concepts Learned

### Variables and Data Types
- `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`
- Variable declaration and initialization
- Scope and lifetime

### Functions
- Function declaration and definition
- Parameters and return types
- Function overloading


## 🔧 Useful Code Snippets

```cpp
// Template for basic C++ program
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```cpp
// Reading input from user
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int number;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> number;
    cout << "You entered: " << number << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## 🏆 Projects I want to do

1. **Calculator** - Basic arithmetic operations
2. **Number Guessing Game** - Random number generation and loops
3. **Student Grade Manager** - Classes and file I/O

*[Add your projects as you complete them]*

## 🐛 Common Mistakes & Solutions

1. **Forgetting semicolons** - Always end statements with `;`
2. **Uninitialized variables** - Always initialize variables before use
3. **Array bounds** - Be careful with array indexing
